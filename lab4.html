      <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
      <p>
        A comparative analysis study of FIR filter implementation reveals that employing various multiplier design strategies 
        can help identify a high-quality response filter from a range of FIR filters. The significance of filters stems from
        the rapid growth of communication systems in recent times, as they play a crucial role in these systems. 
        Filters are extensively utilized in digital signal processing applications to achieve objectives such as
        noise reduction, signal amplification, and data compression. Their primary purpose is to enable the recovery
        of the original signal at the receiver side, allowing for effective communication. Even if the filtered output is
        relatively small, a strong filtered signal can be sent to an amplifier to restore the original signal. To achieve this, 
        it is essential for the filter to be both efficient and well-designed. Given the increasing number of communication systems, 
        selecting the right filter becomes paramount to ensure optimal performance and maintain the integrity of the transmitted signal. 
        By comparing the implementation stats of various FIR filters and considering different multiplier design strategies, 
        it is possible to identify a high-quality response filter. Such a filter will contribute to the effective functioning of communication 
        systems by enabling noise reduction, signal amplification, and data compression, ultimately leading to successful signal recovery at the receiver end.

      <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
      <p>
       Gather The growing popularity of mobile computing and portable multimedia apps has fueled the need for
       compact and high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) solutions. The demand for small and efficient 
       DSP solutions has surged due to the increasing demand for mobile devices, Digital devices and multimedia 
       applications [6]. A key step in DSP systems, Finite Impulse Response [FIR] filtering is frequently applied 
       in communication systems. For a variety of signal processing tasks, Because FIR filters offer effective and 
       dependable filtering capabilities[7]. It is essential to signal processing and makes noise reduction, 
       equalisation, and channel modelling possible. In order to clean up and change signals, digital filters
       are chosen over analogue filters because they provide more accuracy, flexibility, and stability. 
       They are a preferred option in signal processing because they offer better control and accuracy
       when modifying the signal's features[8]. Here filter is made up of three elements Adder, Multiplier,
       Delay element. The multiplier's speed affects the FIR filter processor's execution time and speed. 
       The design of a FIR filter combining Array and Booth multipliers using high-level optimisation approaches was 
       successfully illustrated in this research work [1]. In this second study concluded that using the Booth multiplier 
       greatly reduces chip size without increasing power dissipation, leading to a speedier system [1]. Third study states 
       that "Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra" is a powerful multiplication technique from Vedic mathematics that is introduced
       in this work. Its computing benefits and hierarchical multiplier design are highlighted.[2]. 
       I this work Different multiplier and adder combinations were employed in this to construct microprogrammed 
       sequential and parallel FIR filter topologies on Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. Utilising the Synplify Pro programme 
       to analyse the performance of different architectures, it was discovered that the sequential FIR filter 
       with Wallace tree multiplier/Carry skip adder combination performed more efficiently than the other 
       combinations tested [5]. This study of work states that When a FIR filter is combined with a Booth
       multiplier and carry select adder, it performs better than previous systems in terms of delay, area, and power consumption.
       DSP applications, audio signal processing, and applications involving medical signals all profit greatly from 
       this effective design [3]. This study states in terms of calculating the EDP, the WT multiplier performs better
       than all other proposed multiplication techniques. The WT filter performs better and with less delay over 
       a wider frequency range, whereas the VM and RCA combo produces the lowest EDP for set I frequencies [4]. 
       The review of this study evaluates several adders and multipliers for FIR filter design. Performance-wise, 
       the Han-Carlson Adder, which is based on Vedic mathematics, is the greatest choice, but it consumes a lot of power. 
       The Carry Look Ahead Adder, which is similarly based on Vedic mathematics and delivers good performance and low power 
       consumption, is an alternative [9]. In this study the Karatsuba formula is used to create an effective FIR filter. 
       Three low dynamic range sub-filters make up this filter, which uses a parallel MB pre-encoded CS Wallace tree 
       multiplier for best results. Compared to a conventional transposed FIR filter, the design has better performance, 
       a smaller circuit area, and uses less power. Thus, we test alternative multiplier strategies to see which filter 
       performs more quickly. And, to know the best filter in terms of area, power, delay and performance in the context 
       of operations, analysis of various multiplication approaches is required.
      </p>
      <h4>LITERATURE REVIEW</h4>
      <p>

      <h4>FINITE IMPULSE RESPONSE FILTER</h4>
      <p>
        A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is a digital filter used in signal processing 
        to modify or enhance a signal. It operates by convolving the input signal with a sequence
        of coefficients called the impulse response. The output of the FIR filter is a weighted 
        sum of the past and current input samples. Mathematically,
      </p>
      <p>
        The output y[n] of an FIR filter with N+1 coefficients can be expressed as: y[n] = b[0] * x[n] + b[1] * x[n-1] + b[2] * x[n-2] + ... + b[N] * x[n-N] 
        where x[n] represents the input signal at time index n, and b[0], b[1], ..., b[N] are the filter coefficients.
      </p>
      <p>
        The filter coefficients determine the frequency response and characteristics of the filter. 
        By adjusting the values of the coefficients, different frequency components of the input 
        signal can be selectively amplified or attenuated. FIR filters have several advantages, 
        including stability, linear phase response, and ease of implementation. They are widely 
        used in various applications such as audio and image processing, communications, and control
        systems due to their versatility and predictable behavior.
      </p>
      <h4>MULTIPLIERS</h4>
      <p>
        The multiplier is used to multiply the filter coefficients with the input samples or intermediate values.
        In an FIR filter, each coefficient represents the desired contribution of a specific delayed sample to 
        the output. The multiplier performs the necessary multiplication operation to combine the coefficients 
        with the corresponding input samples.
       
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Booth’s Multiplier : The Booth's multiplier is a multiplication algorithm that reduces the number of partial 
        products generated. It includes blocks such as the partial product generator, Booth’s encoder, and final adder block.
      <p>
        Partial product block creates partial products by multiplying the multiplicand by the multiplier that has been 
        Booth-encoded. By changing the multiplicand based on the multiplier bits, these partial products are created. 
        Booth Encoder block It examines neighboring multiplier bits to decide the kind of encoding necessary. 
        In order to designate whether a partial product should be added or deleted, it generates control signals. 
        Final Adder block It totals all the partial products while accounting for the Booth encoded values and control 
        signals. The aggregate of these partial products yields the ultimate outcome. By taking use of the regularity 
        in the multiplier's bit patterns, Booth's multiplier decreases the number of partial products, enabling quicker 
        multiplication with less hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. Dadda Multiplier : The Dadda multiplier is a binary multiplier that efficiently performs multiplication operations.
        It was developed by Luigi Dadda in the early 1960s and has been widely used in digital circuits. The internal 
        structure of a Dadda multiplier consists of a series of stages, each containing a partial product generation 
        unit and a partial product reduction unit. The partial product generation unit generates all possible partial 
        products by multiplying the bits of the two input numbers. These partial products are then fed into the partial 
        product reduction unit. In the partial product reduction unit, a tree-like structure called the Dadda tree is 
        employed to perform a parallel reduction operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dadda tree efficiently reduces the number of partial products by merging and summing them in a balanced manner. 
        This reduces the number of stages required for the multiplication operation. The Dadda multiplier's internal structure 
        enables it to perform multiplication using a reduced number of logic gates, resulting in faster and more efficient 
        multiplication operations compared to traditional methods. It is commonly used in various applications, 
        including digital signal processing, graphics processing units, and general-purpose processors.
      </p>
      <p>
        C. Vedic Multiplier : A Vedic multiplier is a computational technique derived from ancient Indian mathematical 
        texts known as the Vedas. It is a high-speed multiplication algorithm that can perform multiplication of two 
        numbers in a parallel and efficient manner. The Vedic multiplier is based on the principles of sutras or 
        formulas found in the Vedic mathematics. The basic idea behind the Vedic multiplier is to decompose the 
        numbers being multiplied into smaller parts and then perform a series of arithmetic operations to obtain 
        the result. This decomposition process allows for parallel processing, reducing the overall computation time. 
        The Vedic multiplier consists of several stages, including digit decomposition, partial product generation, 
        and final product addition. Each stage is designed to exploit the properties of the numbers being multiplied 
        and optimize the computational process. The advantages of the Vedic multiplier include its ability to perform 
        multiplication in constant time regardless of the size of the numbers, its low power consumption, and its 
        suitability for implementation in hardware circuits. The Vedic multiplier is a fast and efficient multiplication algorithm 
        based on ancient Indian mathematical principles. It offers advantages such as parallel processing and low power consumption, 
        making it suitable for various applications requiring high-speed multiplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        D. Karatsuba Multiplier : The Karatsuba algorithm, also known as the Karatsuba multiplier, is a fast multiplication
        technique that reduces the number of multiplications required to compute the product of two numbers. It was developed 
        by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1960. The algorithm is based on the observation that the product of two numbers can be expressed 
        using three smaller multiplications instead of the standard four multiplications used in traditional long multiplication. 
        By recursively applying this approach, the number of required multiplications can be significantly reduced, leading to faster 
        multiplication. The Karatsuba algorithm works by splitting the given numbers into two halves, each with half the number of digits. 
        It then recursively computes the products of these halves and combines them to obtain the final product. This technique reduces the 
        overall complexity from O(n^2) to approximately O(n^log2(3)), resulting in significant speed improvements for large numbers. The
        Karatsuba multiplier has applications in various fields where fast multiplication is required, such as cryptography, 
        signal processing, and computer algebra systems. Its efficiency makes it particularly useful when multiplying large numbers 
        with thousands or millions of digits, where traditional long multiplication becomes impractical. Overall, the Karatsuba multiplier 
        offers an efficient method for multiplying large numbers by reducing the number of required multiplications, leading to faster computation 
        times and improved performance in various domains.

      <h4>CARRY LOOK AHEAD ADDER</h4>
      <p>
        A carry look-ahead adder (CLA) is a digital circuit that quickly adds binary numbers by simultaneously 
        calculating carry signals for each stage. It gets rid of the carry propagation delay in ripple carry adders. 
        Each level of the CLA produces carry signals for the relevant bit location. Using AND and XOR gates, 
        carry generation logic determines carry signals depending on input operands and carry input from the prior stage. 
        To determine the ultimate carry outputs, carry propagation goes through cascaded OR gates. Although CLA takes additional
        hardware and becomes more difficult with larger operands, it dramatically increases speed for huge binary values. 
        High-performance arithmetic units frequently employ it.
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <h4>SIMULATION AND RESULTS</h4>
      <p>
        We created a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter for our Vivado-based project in order to examine various multiplier
        strategies and their effects on filter performance. We created several multiplier designs using a modular strategy, 
        and we thoroughly simulated each filter setting to ensure accurate results. We evaluated the performance and trade-offs
        associated with several multiplier architectures (such as Booth, Wallace, and array multipliers) through thorough 
        study, which included metrics like filter responsiveness, signal-to-noise ratio, and overall accuracy. 
        This thorough analysis helped us choose the best multiplier technique for our FIR filter and gave us 
        useful information for future filter designs, increasing the effectiveness of those designs in practical settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 16-bit Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA) is a digital circuit that performs addition on two 16-bit binary numbers. 
        It consists of multiple stages of logic gates, where each stage generates and propagates carry signals in parallel.
        The schematic of a 16-bit CLA adder includes XOR gates for bit-wise addition, AND gates for carry generation, 
        and OR gates for carry propagation, resulting in a high-speed and efficient adder implementation.
      </p>

        The above simulation graph of a D-register represents the behavior of the register over time. It shows 
        the values stored in the register (D input) and how they propagate to the output (Q). The graph typically 
        displays a stable state where the output holds the same value as the input until a clock signal triggers 
        the next input update. The schematic of a D-register illustrates the internal structure, consisting of 
        flip-flops and logic gates that enable the storage and transfer of data.

      <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
      <p>
        Finally, in this context, four approaches have been considered for implementing FIR filters in terms of delay 
        comparison Vedic multiplier with carry-lookahead adder (CLA) and a Karustuba Vedic multiplier with CLA performance
        is better as well as in terms of Area comparison The Karustuba Vedic multiplier with CLA has the better performance
        by comparing all combinations concluded that FIR filter design with Karustuba Vedic multiplier is having
        better performance so, we can design better FIR filter with these adder and multiplier combination.
